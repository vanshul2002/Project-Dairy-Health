<h1>📕 Dairy Health Monitoring System </h1>

<h2>🔧 Problem Statement </h2>
<hr>
Have you ever noticed that our country has a large number of farms and dairy animals, but despite having the most animals, we have a low level of productivity? Is it difficult to keep track of all the animals manually and monitor their daily activities? And Isn't there is lack of the medical facilities?

Dairy Health Monitoring System is the way to solve these kind od problems as it facilitates an IOT smart system.

<br>
Just put the device around the neck of your dairy animal. The device will automatically analyze the daily activity of the farm animal. 

<br>
You will thereby get all the data in the ThingSpeak platform of MATLAB and It show you all the measured quantities on the API. 

<br>
Currently we are using ThingSpeak of MATLAB but in future we will host all the data in our own server
